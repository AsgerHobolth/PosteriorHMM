# PosteriorHMM
R functions for finite Markov chain imbedding (FMCI) and hybrid decoding for hidden Markov models (HMMs). <br/>
## FMCI
FMCI consists of the basic functions provided in **FMCIFunctions.R**. The functions in **HMMPoisExpectations.R** are the forward-backward probabilities, **IMCfunctions.R** is a function for the inhomogeneous transition probabilities, **ViterbiPois.R** is for Viterbi decoding, and finally an example of how to us the functions is available in **FetalLambExample.R**. <br/>
## Hybrid Decoding
Hybrid decoding consists of the basic functions provided in **HybridFunctions.R**, and an example of how to use the functions in **ArtemisExample.R**.
