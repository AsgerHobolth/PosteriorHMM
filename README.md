# PosteriorHMM
R functions for finite Markov chain imbedding (FMCI) and hybrid decoding for hidden Markov models (HMMs). <br/>
## FMCI
FMCI consists of the basic functions provided in FMCIFunctions.R, and an example of how to us the functions in FMCIExample.R. <br/>
## Hybrid Decoding
Hybrid decoding consists of the basic functions provided in HybridFunctions.R, and an example of how to use the functions in ArtemisExample.R
